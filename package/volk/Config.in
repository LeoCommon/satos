	  VOLK is the Vector-Optimized Library of Kernels. 
	  It is a library that contains kernels of hand-written SIMD code 
	  for different mathematical operations. Since each SIMD 
	  architecture can be very different and no compiler has yet come 
	  along to handle vectorization properly or highly efficiently,
	  VOLK approaches the problem differently.
